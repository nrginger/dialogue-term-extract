Here are two examples composed from only the clauses accompanied by graphic gestures. Number before each line relates to the plane’s items.

1 The symbols used are following: underlined words were accompanied by lengthy gestures.
Braces mark the words with any kind of hand movements: often preparative and concluding parts of gesture take some time. The gesture stroke, if it was remarkable, is pointed by vertical bar. About oral discourse notation see Кибрик, Подлесская 2009.

The examples reveal that the speaker follows the line he considers the plot of the story, although details can differ a lot.
Another interesting nuance shown by these examples is that clauses with graphic gestures, marking the key events, are oriented on description of actions and state changes, so the characters in these clauses are often named by pronouns or are not mentioned at all. This corresponds to Vygotsky’s ideas about internal predicate, which is actually the newest in the sentence (Выготский 2005).
There is also dependence between number of gestures and accuracy of the retelling. Our case is not great for detailed quantitative analysis, so these observations remain within the limits of a hypothesis. In the whole, we can suppose, that if the number of clauses with gestures is less than 50 %, there is higher possibility of speaker’s mistakes (when the characters or their actions are depicted Illustrative gestures as markers for discourse macrostructure 557inaccurately, there are a lot of self-corrections and returns to the already told) or listener’s misunderstanding (expressed, e. g., in questions such as “who rode away?”). It’s not a rule, just a tendency. For example, in the narration with minimum gestures (only 7 % clauses were with visual illustrations) there were no such mistakes and listener’s questions.
Whish of the factors (defi cit of gestures or vagueness of narration) is dominant, is not yet clear. We have an example which can point out a possible answer.
Here is a part of this narration (bold are listener’s remarks)(3) Then three boys pass by,
From somewhere(.. 0.2) they help him to collect the pears,
Shake him off,(... ааа .. 1.5) and the boy quickly leaves,(...0.5) then these boys=— With the pears.
— Yes, | with the pears.
He went further already,
Then these boys whistle,(... 0.7) (
Like=(..0.2) A sort of= this story is without words_)
But(...0.5) They wanted to give him his hat.
They returned,
Took three pears,(... аam .... 2.0) started eating them,— You mean he came back,
Gave them pears_— No, he went further,(...0.9) they whistled,
And he stopped,
They approached him,
Took the pears.
(... 0.5) Well, they go=(ааm0.7) they go,
And pass by the tree,
Where the man picks the pears.
This example shows, that after listener’s questions the number of speaker’s gestures increases. It’s obvious, that the purpose of his gesticulation is to explain clearer who and where moves in the fi lm. On the other hand, visual signs undoubtedly help the speaker to recall the plot and to process spatial-dynamic information, so it’s easier for him to convey his ideas verbally.
Iu. Nikolaeva
Upon these observations we can suppose the following conclusions.
1. Graphic gestures mark the points in the narration the speaker considers
to be key or turning for the story.
2. Their appearance, generally, correlates with lower number of speaker’s mistakes.
3. Usually the listener understands the story better when there are enough illustrative gestures.
