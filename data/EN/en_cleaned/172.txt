The idea of corpora that contain big data has attracted scholars’ attention for a long time. However, it was the availability of wide technical opportunities that gave impetus to the development of a new research field which enables researchers to collect data automatically from the Internet (see, for example ). Researchers found it attractive to make statistical inferences and to verify the results on increasingly larger scope of data. 1 mln or 100 mln tokens are not thresholds for the corpora. At the same time access to big corpora provokes new challenges: what can we see with big data and how does it affect the results? Do linguists actually need large corpora or their appetites can be satisfied with less data? Can small corpora be viewed as little big ones ?1. Large Russian Corpora
Large corpora with volumes exceeding 100 mln tokens have appeared just recently. This idea is closely related to the technical resources and thus the gradually changing paradigm in corpus linguistics moving forward from “manual” approach to more automatic one. Nowadays one can speak about two types of corpora, some authors distinguish between three types . For the Russian language the most famous and popular corpus of the first type is the National Russian Corpus; altogether its subcorpora comprise 600 mln words. This corpus was built according to the “classic” style, i.e. linguists selected relevant texts, annotated them and included into the database. Corpora of the second type are collected automatically from the Web (frankly speaking, to a certain degree that holds true for the first type also). For the Russian language we can name “
The General Internet
Corpus of Russian” that now exceeds 15,000 mln words and its authors aim at 50,000 mln words . Also, there is a number of corpora made within the Aranea project, which includes a Russian corpus called Araneum Russicum Maius & Minus . The Russian Web corpus was collected by S. Sharoff the methodology for crawling web-based texts outlined in . The developers use a list of 500 most frequent words in a language that are Large Corpora and Frequency Nouns not function words and don’t belong to a specific domain. At the next stage a program produces a list of queries (from 5,000 up to 8,000); each of them consists of 4 words from the list. As an output there is a new list of web links, 10 top results are used for downloading files. The next step requires further postprocessing, such as encoding correction, removing duplicates (filtering pages in other languages using the same alphabet, e.g. deleting texts written in Cyrillic in Slavic languages other than Russian) and technical information. The Ten
Ten family corpora of various languages of the order of 10 billion words. The ruTen
Ten Russian corpus is one of the biggest among them along with the English, German, French and Spanish collections. Building these corpora implies that special attention is paid to the process of de-duplication in order to delete multiple copies of the same chunks of texts and thus to reduce postprocessing. Also the crawler downloads texts that have only full sentences (not navigation data).
The above-mentioned technologies can be found attractive enabling the researchers to create corpora of different languages and not demanding the time-consuming stage of collecting texts (however, this advantage can be questioned if we remember about such inherent properties of a corpus and a sample as their representativeness and balance).
To our best knowledge, there are no large corpora studies of linguistic phenomena on the Russian data, which would come up with a comparative analysis of these corpora (e.g. “big” vs. “little” corpora or “manual” vs. “automatic”). A survey of the Aranea Russian corpora was made in . For the English corpora the χ2-test as a suitable measure for comparing corpora that outperforms other methods. For Chinese corpora an attempt of evaluation is described in . Comparative analysis of frequency lists can be viewed as a similar issue to a certain degree. For Russian the method was proposed in the Cxy measure.
2. Experiments
The aim of our research is to compare frequency properties of a number of Russian nouns across corpora of different sizes, to identify differences, and to analyze them. We selected several corpora that had been collected and built automatically—the Russian Web corpus by S. Sharoff (187.97 mln tokens), ruTen
Ten (18.28 bln tokens) and its sample (1.25 bln tokens). The latter is a subcorpus of the ruTen
Ten corpus that was randomly generated, so it comprises the same texts but differs in size from ruTen
Ten. To succeed in our study we studied properties of highand low frequency nouns that had been selected from the dictionary.
2.1. High
Frequency Nouns: Selection
The majority of Russian texts in web corpora come from news websites, blogs, commercial websites, social media groups etc. Fiction texts are less common for such Khokhlova M. V.
therefore, we decided to focus on high-frequency vocabulary that is associated with the above-mentioned functional styles. To this end, we compiled two word lists. One word list (see Tables 1 and 2) contained nouns that the Frequency Dictionary top by frequency in social and political journalism and non-fiction texts (the Frequency Dictionary provides separate frequency lists for both types of texts). Hence both lists include top 10 nouns for the given style.

The other list contains nouns that belong to the so-called style-specific vocabulary (i.e. typical) either social and political journalism or non-fiction texts (see Tables 3 and 4).

Frequency Nouns: Results
In our research we have also analyzed 10 top-frequency nouns in the three corpora. The Russian Web Corpus list was almost identical to the list in . The results for the two other corpora are more exciting. For example, 1 The logarithmic likelihood score is a static measure used by the authors of the dictionary
to identify style-specific vocabulary. In Tables 3 and 4 the results are arranged according to this parameter.

Ten (and the subset) contains four such nouns. Moreover, both corpora agree on the ranking of the four words vremja, vopros, process and stat’ja. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between the ranked word lists in the Frequency Dictionary and in Russian Web Corpus is 0.61, whereas the coefficient between the Frequency Dictionary and the ruTen

At the next stage of our experiment we looked at the frequencies of nouns on the style-specific word lists (
Tables 3 and 4). The results for the two style-specific groups of nouns are summarized in Table 7 and Fig. 3 and in Table 8 and Fig. 4 respectively.
It can be seen from Fig. 3 and 4 that the Frequency Dictionary subcorpus shows highest frequencies (in ipm), which is hardly surprising. Although style-specific words were selected not by absolute frequencies, but rather by the L
L-score, this measure is still indicative of the number of units in the subcorpus, which in turn explains the fact why some lexemes with frequencies above corpus average values are marked as style-specific. The four nouns sistema, process, sud, federacija, risunok and virus have no discrepancy in ranking across the two corpora—
Russian Web Corpus and ruTen
Ten. This is the largest number of words with identical ranking across the corpora. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between the ranked word lists in the Frequency Dictionary and Russian Web Corpus is 0.92 and can indicate that the data on the non-fiction word list of style-specific vocabulary and the corpus data are largely identical (though to a lesser extent, the same is true for the ruTen
Ten corpus data, with the equally high Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the Frequency Dictionary and the corpus standing at 0.73).

Large Corpora and Frequency Nouns It is particularly remarkable, that the maximum initial value on the chart corresponds to the frequency of god and is present on each graph. The explanation is that this noun is top three by frequency in all the three corpora. The Russian Web Corpus failed to produce any results for the lexeme vybory, because according to its morphological token the usage of this lemma merges with the lemma vybor. The first four nouns god, strana, kompanija and prezident have identical ranking in the Russian Web Corpus and the Frequency Dictionary (both in the main corpus and the subcorpus). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is equally top high for the Frequency Dictionary and Russian Web Corpus standing at 0.95.
2.3. Low Frequency Nouns: Selection
The selection of low-frequency nouns is quite tricky. For this aim we analyzed the Frequency Dictionary paying attention to the tail of the frequency list and selected 12 low-frequency nouns ranked between the following two ranges: 1) 18,940–18,965;
2) 19,955–20,000 in the Frequency Dictionary .

Low Frequency Nouns: Results
The data shown in Table 9 suggests that the differences between the Frequency Dictionary and corpora are not apparently reconciled in case of low frequency words. Spearman’s coefficient has the following values (as compared to the results with the high-frequency nouns): 0.33 for the Frequency Dictionary and ruTen
Ten sample corpus, 0.22 for the Frequency Dictionary and ruTen
Ten corpus and 0.21 for the Frequency Dictionary and the Russian Web corpus. However, the Russian Web Corpus shows similar high coherence in data both with the ruTen
Ten and ruTen
Ten sample corpora (
Spearman’s correlation coefficient is 0.80 and 0.79 respectively). Hence for the given low-frequency words the difference between the corpora and the Frequency Dictionary is more obvious than between the corpora in question. This fact can imply that corpora automatically crawled from the web share more in common with each other that with the National Russian Corpus (that served as the source for the Frequency Dictionary). Low values of the Spearman’s coefficient imply that nouns differ a lot in their ranks between the latter corpus and other corpora and it is crucial in case of low-frequency words.
3. Conclusion and Future Work
The general conclusion from the obtained data suggests that texts selected for large corpora reflect the language of the web. The results published in the Frequency Dictionary are based on the Russian National Corpus, which makes them so coherent. High-frequency nouns indicated in non-fiction texts tend to be more similar to the ruTen
Ten corpus, whereas words fixed in the social and political journalisms subcorpus share a lot with data in the Russian Web Corpus. Thus, the Russian Web Corpus has more in common with newspaper articles. The analysis of high-frequency nouns and their ranking positions in both 1 bln subset and 14 bln corpus shows that they have produced the same results, but this is not true for the low frequency nouns. In case of low frequency data three corpora do not show much coincidence with the Frequency Dictionary lists. However we can say that in general the sample shares similar features with the total set (ruTen
Ten) and hence in this sense small corpora can be used for evaluating word frequencies. The nouns (sajt, sistema, kompanija, and Rossija) that are ranked top by frequency in the ruTen
Ten corpus and its billion-size subset, but are missing among the results in the Frequency Dictionary, reveal the specific properties of web-based texts—firstly, their abundance and secondly, the focus on describing the web-page content. If we use more high-frequency nouns the Spearman’s coefficient will be lower because of the diversity in ranks of the words. But the value of the coefficient will be constantly higher (than if we increase the number low-frequency words as it will be even negative).
The Russian Web Corpus appears to be more consistent with the Frequency Dictionary than the ruTen
Ten corpus in describing high-frequency nouns. The differences between the corpora are apparently reconciled in case of high-frequency words, but the opposite doesn’t hold true for the low-frequency words.
Large Corpora and Frequency Nouns We believe that these experiments have a future. It is crucial to study the results for low frequency words, because this group of words is the one that may produce entirely different numeric values for large corpora. To be more specific, preliminary results of our collocations study have shown that higher absolute frequency of a particular lexical item is not always conducive to a larger number of relations for the said item (despite greater number of syntagmatic partners, typical for each relation).
