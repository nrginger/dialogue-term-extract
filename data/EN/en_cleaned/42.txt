Text simplification consists of modifying the content and structure of a text in order to make it easier toread and understand, while preserving its main idea and approximating its original meaning.
In the RuSimpleSent
Eval task simplification was performed at the sentence level. In this formulation,the goal is to obtain a simplified sentence from a complex one. The criteria for sentence complexityinclude presence of complex grammatical constructions, subordinate clauses, the presence of rare andambiguous words, etc.
Our goal was to evaluate how well the finetuned autoregressive ruGP
T3 model would handle the task.
We approach the problem in three steps. At first, we use only Russian sentences from provided trans足lated Wiki
Large corpus and filter it by cosine similarity and ROUGE足
L (Recall足
Oriented Understudyfor Gisting Evaluation for Longest Common Subsequence) between complex and simplifiedsentences. We keep pairs with high cosine similarity and medium ROUGE足
L values.
Further, we finetune pretrained ruGP
T3 on the filtered dataset similarly to finetuning for paraphrasing.
And finally, we use the finetuned model to generate simplified candidates using the complex sentenceas a prompt. To choose from several generated candidates a random forest model is used. It is trainedto predict SAR
