It is a known fact that depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and it affects millions of people around the world . Depression can make a significant impact on the daily lifestyle and behavior of people. At the same time, a considerable number of depression cases stay untreated or undetected . It is also known that severe types of depression affect the way human thinks and, therefore, influence human ability to express thoughts in oral speech and writings . The psycholinguistic investigating this impact of depression and other mental diseases on human linguistics and propose some valuable methodology on it. But manual psycholinguistic analysis requires a lot of effort and time. Development of natural language processing tools allows to partially solve this problem . At the same time, machine learning methods present a lot of opportunities to reveal human psychological attributes when applied on text data, for example in social media . We currently aimed to develop such methods for the Russian social media and users’ writings. But for the Russian language, we are lacking background knowledge about relations between psychological attributes of the human and his text.
The main idea of the study consists in applying machine learning and natural language processing tools to perform on the task of depression detection in essay writings on the Russian language. We formed two collections of essays: 93 essays written by people with clinically diagnosed depression, and 223 essays written by volunteers who completed a psychological questionnaire to confirm they did not demonstrate any depression signs. Thus, we focused on binary classification in order to evaluate the ability of machine learning approach to detect if a text belongs to depressed or healthy subject. We present features retrieved from essays including classical text features, psycholinguistic features, n-grams, and sentiment. It is important to note that currently there are no studies devoted to the depression detection task among Russian language and the psycholinguistic features proposed in the study are not previously tested on similar tasks.

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIW
C) is one of the most frequently used tools for automatic text analysis for researches related to psychology and psycholinguistics . The main idea embodied in this tool is that the author’s psychological characteristics are related to the text’s quantitative parameters: the frequency of punctuation marks, words of a certain part of speech (prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, adverbs), words of a certain lexic-semantic group (negative or positive emotions, describing cognitive processes).
The task of depression detection mostly focused on social media data. There is a lot of studies that consider the task of detection depression by analyzing social media messages. The work presented in the classification of social media messages written by depressed and healthy users. The authors achieved 74% of accuracy with SV
M classifier using the following features: social media activity, time, N-grams, postags, and features based on LIW
C.
Stankevich M. A. al.
Another work observes depression detection problem as a task of detecting vocabulary related to 9 depression symptoms . Authors processed messages from Twitter to indicate the presence of these symptoms in users’ writings. This approach is based on the observation that users of social networks frequently write about their mental state . The experiments were focused on multi-label classification and comparison of semi-supervised topic modeling over time model (ssTo
T) with supervised SV
M and Multinomial Naive Bayes approaches based on bag-of-words features. The ssTo
T model yielded 68% averaged accuracy which is competitive with a fully supervised approach presented in the study.
It is important to note studies presented by CL
Psych 2015 shared task competitors . The shared task provided dataset which consists of text messages samples from Twitter that belongs to users with depression and PTS
D. The best average precision (roughly 87%) on the depression vs control task was achieved by the method based on lexical features with tf-idf weighting .

The second place on the first task was achieved by the team that utilized tf-idf and sentiment features with ensembles of different methods: ridge regression, SV

The best submitted classification model yielded 64% of F1-score by the team who applied an ensemble of tf-idf based classifiers on the
data . It is important to note that the same team reworked their models after Clef/e
Risk 2017 Shared Task completion and reported 73% F1-score on the same train/test data by utilizing sophisticated linguistic metadata features (including LIW
C) with logistic regression .
The analysis of related works reveals that it is hard to strictly compare the results of our research with others. The data and experiments design presented in these works differ from study to study and covering only the English-speaking population. The social media based datasets contain much more textual information for each person, but at the same time it much noisier than essays. But we can observe the methods and approaches that yield promising results on depression detection task. For both CL

C features. Although LIW
C is a very popular and effective tool, there is no appropriate adaptation for the Russian language. It is also missing some psycholinguistic characteristics of the text.
Predicting Depression from Essays in Russian3. Dataset
The dataset for the research contains two classes of texts: 93 essays written by people with depression (depression group) and 223 essays written by healthy people (control group). Depression essays were collected with the collaboration of two different teams of the psychologist who asked patients with depression disorder to write a short essay with a minimum length of 1800 characters. The control group essays were written mostly by students from different universities and different education programs (psychology, sociology, journalism, and information technology). Volunteers completed Russian adaptation of Beck Depression Inventory reveal their depression status and only essays written by persons who did not demonstrate depression signs were included in the control group (score less than 14 on the 0–63 Beck Depression Inventory scale). Thus, volunteers from the depression group did not complete the same questionnaire because their depression status was revealed by clinical experts with face to face diagnostic, which is superior to questionnaires. In the other hand, this fact forbids us from investigating this task as regression analysis. The topic of the essays is similar for both depression and control groups. We can generalize this topic as “
Me and my relations with others and the world around me”. Minimal age of volunteers for both groups is 18.
We should highlight two assumptions that we made around the depression group to perform classification on the dataset. First, the depressive disorder can be divided into many subtypes, and each form of depression has a different severity. Secondly, the part of the depression essays was written by patients who have already taken medications, but another part was written by untreated persons. In another hand, it is a very difficult task to collect a big number of essays from people with clinically confirmed depression. Utilizing machine learning tools require a sufficient number of training examples, which forced us to generalize all of the depression types as one and ignore the fact of medication use by depressed patients.
We present general statistics on the dataset in in the depression group is 59% females and 41% males. Gender distribution in the control group is 69% females and 31% males.

Stankevich M. A. al.4. Methods4.1. N-grams
Tf-idf and n-grams features are common natural language processing approach which performed well on depression detection task. Thus, we included 2 tf-idf based feature sets: unigrams and bigrams. N-grams that appeared less than in 1% of essays and more than in 90% of essays were removed from the feature sets. The result of tSN
E the bigrams data demonstrated in Figure 1.
4.2. Depression markers
We annotated following feature set as Depression Markers (D
M). It is containing classical text features (mean word/sentence length, PO
S-tags ratio) and psycholinguistic features. The part of psycholinguistic features described in following works , , , , and another part were proposed during the manual analysis of essays by psychologists and linguists. An important point is that most of these features were not previously tested on depression detection task.
Predicting Depression from Essays in Russian
To retrieve features from the essays we applied tokenization, lemmatization, and morphological analysis with My
Stem. Statistics for D
M presented in Table 2 (excluding PO
S-tags ratio). By observation of morphology related features, it can be noted that verbs and pronouns in various forms yield a lot of differences between groups. The smaller mean depth of syntax tree and mean number of words per sentence demonstrate a tendency of depression group to express themselves with shorter sentences. The (
N verbs) / (
N adjectives) ratio, which is also known as Trager coefficient, is usually differ from 1 among people with higher mental stress, which is also differ in our report among depression group .

Another valuable feature was computed with the help of Linis Crowd word sentiments dictionary . The dictionary provides information about words estimated values of positive (1, 2), negative (−1, −2) or neutral (0) sentiment. We calculated the sentiment rate of each document by matching words from the essay with dictionary values and then summing it up. As demonstratedin Figure 2, sentiment rates for each group greatly vary and have been included in the feature set. This value was included in the D
M set.
Stankevich M. A. al.5. Result of experiments
To perform classification, we utilized scikit-learn of random forest and SV
M algorithms. Overall, we evaluate 5 different sets of features: depression markers (D
M) that was described in section 4.2, tf-idf model computed on unigrams, tf-idf model computed on bigrams, and combination of n-gram models with depression markers. The classification report represented as averaged result of 5-fold cross-validation on the data (
Table 3). Recall, precision, and F1-score calculated for the class of depression.
Depression markers model achieved best score in terms of overall classification performance on the data with 84% accuracy. N-grams based model also performed well with a F1-score around 70%. The combination of all models yielded best result for the task of depression essays classification with 73% F1-score. We relate the high values of standard deviation to the small number of samples in the data. The SV
M based models are also yield best performance with bigrams features.
As it was mentioned before, it is hard to provide strict comparison with similar works, since the data format and language is different than in other studies. In terms of experiments design, studies related to the Clef/e
Risk 2017 is the closest ones. The best reported F1-score for depression class on Clef/e
Risk 2017 data is also 73% , which is close to F1-score in our experiments.

The study evaluates the ability of machine learning models and several types of feature sets to perform classification on essays in Russian written by depressed and healthy peoples. The depression markers that was described in the paper, as well as standard NL
P approaches like unigrams and bigrams, demonstrated good performance on the data. The Bigrams+D
M feature set achieved the best results for the task of revealing depression essays with 73% F1-score. It was discovered that applying word sentiment dictionaries as Linis Crowd is suitable for the depression detection task. We considering this study as a first step in the machine learning based depression detection from texts in Russian.
We currently looking forward to investigating the ability of word embeddings and neural networks models to identify depression in human writings. The dataset possibly will become public-available for research purposes in the fully anonymized format. As a general idea for future work, we planning to apply depression detection methods on Russian-speaking social networks.
