Moscow, June 15–18, 2022encoder-decoder framework are very close to the text written by humans, including lots of security issues(de Rosa and Papa, 2021; Topal et al., 2021). Extensive Transformer-based text generation models, suchas Bert-stytle (
Devlin et al., 2018a), GP
T-stytle (
Radford et al., 2019), have achieved excellent resultson a large number of NL
P tasks. (
Keskar et al., 2019) proposed the conditional transformer languagemodel (CTR
L) with 1.63 billion parameters to control the text generation. The model is trained withdifferent codes that control task-specific behavior, entities, specify style and content. (
Zellers et al.,2019) introduced a controllable text generation model named Grover, which can overwrite propaganda
papers. For example, given a headline "
Discovering the link between vaccines and autism," Grover couldgenerate a description article for this title. Humans rated this generated text as more trustworthy thanhuman-written text. However, the success of natural language generation has drawn dual-use concerns.
On the one hand, applications such as summary generation and machine translation are positive. Onthe other hand, related techniques may also enable adversaries to generate neural fake news, targetedpropaganda and even fake political content. Therefore, several researchers have made many attemptsto develop artificial text detectors (
Jawahar et al., 2020). (

It is noted that the pre-trained model has a solid ability to differentiate the results generated by differentmodels (
Qiu et al., 2020; Naseem et al., 2021), we resort to the state-of-the-art (SOT
A) pre-trained
Li B., Weng Y., Song Q., Deng H.language model for better prediction. As shown in Figure 1, we present the main model architecturefor the shared task. Specifically, we adopt the DeBER
Ta family, i.e., mDeBER
Ta (
He et al., 2020) andDeBER
Ta (
He et al., 2021a), for the category classification. The pooling and fully connected layersare at the top of the pre-trained language model for leveraging global semantics. Finally, the argmax isperformed after the 14 categories classification to obtain the final results.
2.2 Multiple Training Strategies
2.2.1 Adversarial Training
The common method in adversarial training is the Fast Gradient Method (
Nesterov, 2013; Dong et al.,2018). The idea of FG
M is straightforward. Increasing the loss is to increase the gradient so that we can
take∆𝑥𝑥 = 𝜖𝜖∇𝑥𝑥𝐿𝐿(𝑥𝑥𝑥 𝑥𝑥; 𝜃𝜃) (1)where 𝑥𝑥 represents the input, 𝑥𝑥 represents the label, 𝜃𝜃 is the model parameter, 𝐿𝐿(𝑥𝑥𝑥 𝑥𝑥; 𝜃𝜃) is the loss of asingle sample, ∆𝑥𝑥 is the anti-disturbance.
Of course, to prevent ∆𝑥𝑥 from being too large, it is usually necessary to standardize ∇𝑥𝑥𝐿𝐿(𝑥𝑥𝑥 𝑥𝑥; 𝜃𝜃).
The more common way is∆𝑥𝑥 = 𝜖𝜖∇𝑥𝑥𝐿𝐿(𝑥𝑥𝑥 𝑥𝑥; 𝜃𝜃)‖∇𝑥𝑥𝐿𝐿(𝑥𝑥𝑥 𝑥𝑥; 𝜃𝜃)‖(2)2.2.2 Child-tuning Training
The efficient Child-tuning (
Xu et al., 2021) method is used to fine-tuning the backbone model in ourmethod, where the parameters of the Child network are updated with the gradients mask. For this sharedtask, the task-independent algorithm is used for child-tuning. When fine-tuning, the gradient masks areobtained by Bernoulli Distribution (
Chen and Liu, 1997) sampling from in each step of iterative update,which is equivalent to randomly dividing a part of the network parameters when updating. The equationof the above steps is shown as followsw𝑡𝑡+1 = w𝑡𝑡 − 𝜂𝜂𝜕𝜕ℒ (w𝑡𝑡)𝜕𝜕w𝑡𝑡⊙𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡
B𝑡𝑡 ∼ Bernoulli (𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹 )(3)where the notation ⊙ represents the dot production, 𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹 is the partial network parameter.
2.2.3 Ensemble Method
Once obtaining the pre-trained model, we need to maximize the advantages of each model. So, weuse ensemble each model with the Bagging Algorithm (
Skurichina and Duin, 2002) via voting on thepredicted results of the trained models. The Bagging algorithm is used during the prediction, wherethis method can effectively reduce the variance of the final prediction by bridging the prediction bias ofdifferent models, enhancing the overall generalization ability of the system.

Wolf et al., 2020) framework. For all uninitialized layers, We set the dimension of allthe hidden layers in the model as 1024. The AdamW(
Loshchilov and Hutter, 2018) optimizer which isa fixed version of Adam (
Kingma and Ba, 2014) with weight decay, and set 𝛽𝛽1 to 0.9, 𝛽𝛽2 to 0.99 for theoptimizer. We set the learning rate to 1𝑒𝑒 − 5 with the warm-up (
He et al., 2016). The batch size is 32.
We set the maximum length of 280, and delete the excess. Linear decay of learning rate and gradientclipping is set to 1𝑒𝑒 − 4. Dropout (
Srivastava et al., 2014) of 0.1 is applied to prevent over-fitting. Allexperiments select the best parameters in the valid set. Finally, we report the score of the best model(valid set) in the test set.
We use the mDeBER
Ta-base (

Human",with 44%, followed by“M2

Further conclusions can be that sorting from high to low actually shows the capability performance of themodel. The higher the error rate, the better the performance of the model, and the effects like M2M/GP
T3are better. Then the bigger the model, the harder the target is to distinguish.
5 Result and Discussion
As shown in Table 1, we implement the DeBER
Ta-large and mDeBER
Ta-large with multiple trainingstrategies. It can be further concluded that the in trust loss method with the pre-trained model can achievethe best results in artificial text detection. It may be the reason that the model is trained through In-trusttraining. can be more robust. Moreover, we found that the mDeBER
Ta outperforms the original version,which indicates that the multi-lingual can provide differentiated knowledge for this text detection. Table2 also presents the comparison between ours and baselines, where our method outperforms the BER
T
baseline by 2.397 in accuracy score on the official test set.
6 Conclusion
This paper illustrates our contributions for Russian Artificial Text Detection Dialogue Shared task (Multi
Class). We use the DeBER
Ta pre-trained language model with multiple traning strategies to distinguishwhich model from the list was used to generate this text. In the evaluation phase, our submission achievessecond place.
